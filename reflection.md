The crash course was instrumental in helping me learn how to use  the GUI interface on Visual Studio Code in support of using the CLI.

The crash course also allowed me to learn how to work with issues and naming practices for branches commits and projects. While doing the aforementioned tasks I was also able to learn how to handle merge conflicts better.
